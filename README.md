Decision Tree is a Supervised learning technique that is mostly preferred for solving Classification problems. It is a tree-structured classifier, where internal nodes represent the features of a dataset, branches represent the decision rules and each leaf node represents the outcome.

In Simple words it is a graphical representation for getting all the possible solutions to a problem/decision based on given conditions.
